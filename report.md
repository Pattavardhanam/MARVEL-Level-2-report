## CFD
My exploration of aerodynamics took a thrilling flight with Autodesk CFD. This powerful software allowed me to delve into the fascinating world of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), offering a visually stunning experience.  Autodesk CFD's strength lies in its meticulous detail, enabling the simulation of various fluids (compressible or incompressible) and even incorporating heat transfer.  In this project, I harnessed the DAT to Spline plugin to streamline the process.  After acquiring the coordinates for a NACA 2412 airfoil from an online database, I meticulously crafted a wing model in Fusion360, with the ability to precisely adjust its scale, camber, and offset.  The completed wing, assigned aluminum properties, was then seamlessly imported into the CFD environment.

To simulate real-world conditions, I meticulously constructed a virtual win m/s tunnel around the wing model. The surrounding fluid was designated as air, and a realistic wind velocity of 2 was set.  The simulation meticulously ran through 25 iterations, generating a wealth of data for various parameters.  This rich dataset allowed me to calculate the crucial aerodynamic forces acting on the wing: drag coefficient and lift. This project provided a deeper understanding of how air interacts with a wing, offering valuable insights into the science of flight.
